## About the notebook:
* This notebook submission scored 2.08196 on public leaderboard (60% data) and 1.95813 on private leaderboard (remaining 40% data)
* **Overall Rank 5** in the competition
--------
## Thought Process:
* My initial choice for the model was using XGBRegressor with hyperparameter tuning with hyperopt
  * This was not working out well as my public leaderboard scores were floating around 2.20.
* Next I went with neural networks and my scores started improving
  * Changed the parameters with trial-and-error and submitted the model which looked the most promising
  * Notebook in this repo has the neural network architecture which was used for my best submission (it was an abnormal fit but I went with it anyway :P)
